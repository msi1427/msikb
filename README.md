Learning online turned into one of my habits due to the availability of many quality contents that are open-source. I lose track of what I was doing and what needs to be done every now and then. So I decided to open this repository and store everything valuable I come across which are related to the topics I am interested in. 
I am not storing anything directly related to machine learning or artificial intelligence here. They are stored in https://github.com/msi1427/msiai 
Interesting topics include algorithm, data-structure, calculus, probability, linear algebra, and many other miscellaneous things. The exact details are in 'course_list' file <br/>
# Contents:
course_list => The courses I am taking or have already taken online.<br/>
hand_notes => My handwritten notes of the courses in course_list in PDF.<br/>helpful_links => Good tutorials or walkthrough I came across. <br/>walkthroughs => Video walkthrough URLs on the knowledge I am gaining from different sources <br/>
