# Things I did

I have a plan for taking preparation for GRE test in 4 months. After consulting with some of my friend who took the GRE test, firstly I bought 6-month Magoosh Premium subscription. I will be listing down the things I did onwards.

- Magoosh provides 4 types of study plans. Since I had a plan to take prep in 4 months **I started following the 3-month beginner plan**. Don't get caught up by the 3-month advanced plan. The beginner plan covers both. If you go for the advanced one, you might miss some beginner things which helps in building basic and intuition. However, you can go for the advanced things right from the beginning if you are an advanced candidate. Follow the plan you choose day by day. You can increase your pace if you think that the materials of are easy for you.
- **I downloaded the GRE Vocabulary Flashcards App from Google Play Store.** You can use it for free. I found out that we can learn and revise our vocabulary using the app more easily than keeping a note or something.

# Tricks I followed

## Vocabulary

- Vocabulary is the hardest part for me in the GRE test. So, **I started to learn vocabulary with mnemonics**.

## Quantitative Reasoning

- **Stop thinking that you will be using GRE calculator to solve problems during test.** Build up number sense and practice doing GRE maths not using any sort of calculator.

## Verbal Reasoning

### Reading Comprehension

- Persuade your brain that what you are going to read is going to be interesting.
- Be steady while reading.
- Stop and summarize on each sentence.
- Read articles from places like The Economist, The Guardian, New York Times and so on in your leisure time to practice reading.
