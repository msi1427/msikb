**My Approach to each section:**

- **Reading:** 
  - Get the main idea of each paragraph and how it is related to other paragraphs.
  - Take some notes as you go through each paragraph.
  - Answer a question before looking into the answer choices.
  - Justify your chosen answer from the text.
- **Listening:**
  - Try to get the main idea of a conversation or a lecture while listening. 
  - Don't focus too much on trivial details.
  - Take short notes if needed.
- **Speaking:**
  - Understand what TOEFL wants from you here. Best place is to look into the [rubrics](https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_speaking_rubrics.pdf).
  - Be natural. Do not worry about mistakes while talking.
  - Take short notes in the integrated sections.
  - The sections are predictable so it is better to follow a structure while talking.
- **Writing:**
  - Just like speaking section, understand the [rubrics](https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_writing_rubrics.pdf) first. 
  - Take short notes in the integrated sections.
  - Try to be careful about grammatical mistakes.
  - Keep some time aside for revision.
- **Overall:**
  - Do not burn yourself out. This is not the end of the world.
  - If you can manage, try to follow GregMat resources even if they are paid. You can get all GregMat resources for 5 USD per months which is very cheap for the content it provides.

**Disclaimer:** <br/>

- I prepared for GRE before I started preparing for TOEFL. 
- Though English is not my native language, the medium of communication and study was English in my undergraduate university, Islamic University of Technology (IUT).
- I used to communicate with international clients and collaborators in English during my time at Omdena Inc. and Pioneer Alpha Ltd. 
- I used to listen to podcasts, online academic lectures, public lectures, etc. in English for a long time before I started taking preparation for TOEFL.  

*I listed the disclaimer so that someone who wants to follow the resources, instructions and methods I followed can understand my starting point and plan their trajectory from their starting point.*
